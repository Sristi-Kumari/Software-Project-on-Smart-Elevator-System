# Software-Project-on-Smart-Elevator-System
We are creating an app for Elevator Management System using Python Tkinter. 
This interface will help the users to book their slot for the elevator and know the waiting time for them to reach their destination prior so that they can save their time and plan their time accordingly. 
At the time of huge crowd at the time of peek time, priority will be given to higher floors as climbing stairs might be tiring. 
As the user login to the app using their credentials, they first have to select the floor, then time slot and the time.
Then the window will show the necessary details regarding their waiting time and elevator number. 
After completing the journey the user will be directed to the feedback page where they can give their suggestions which will be further taken into consideration by
the server and improvements can be made in the system.
